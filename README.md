# STA561 Final Project
This repo contains the code and reports for my collaborative final project on clustering music based on their audio features using clustering algorithms alongside dimentionality reduction methods. The [Poster](https://github.com/Eric-Su-2718/Music-Feature-Project/blob/master/STA561_Final_Project_Poster.pdf) and [Report](https://github.com/Eric-Su-2718/Music-Feature-Project/blob/master/STA561_Final_Project_report.pdf) can be accessed by clicking on them.

Methods used include:
* K-means clustering
* Hierarchical clustering
* Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for clustering
* Principal component analysis (PCA)
* t-SNE
* Autoencoder
